Introduction: Marketing Consultancy Problem**\n\nThe marketing teams involved in Travel, Tourism & Housing are faced with the need to provide ever more quality information that is tailored to the individual customers needs. In this era of information overload, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with the information on all the seemingly available choices, without being able to get the best use out of all the information  \n\nCustomers today are highly aware of the market and as a result the industry has become highly competitive. This makes it essential to understand the client\u2019s need in the shortest possible time and present the options most suitable for their tastes.\n\nFor my project, I present the example of **a travel advisor who was approached by a client looking for a neighborhood to stay for a short term, in and around Toronto. The client has provided some information about his tastes and preference towards some neighborhoods he likes/ dislikes the most.  The challenge for this advisor lies in understanding & exploiting client information that lacks linear structure and using it to recommend location clusters. Additionally, the sheer volume of predictions of possible neighborhoods also poses a challenge.** \n\nThe Toronto area is spread over 630.2 square kilometers and like any big city has a mix of neighborhoods with varying density of shops, establishments, open areas and recreation facilities. One of the big factors in such a search for suitable neighborhood is obviously the available budget, but there is also the question of the entire makeup of the neighborhood. For the purposes of this project, the budget is not being taken into consideration and the focus will be on the facilities and infrastructure. To bring all this information on a visual scale which is easily understandable and also scalable with the ability to focus or zoom in further will help the client get a cleaner understanding of the options matching their outlook and lifestyle.   \n",

Materials & Methods: Data Collection to Clustering, Recommendation & Classification**\n\n#### **2.1 Project Objective**\nTo Explore, cluster, recommend the neighborhoods of Toronto using k-means Clustering, Recommender Systems and then classify the clients\u2019 profile based on their neighborhood preferences, applying various Machine Learning Algorithms.\n\n#### **2.2 Data collection**\nThis project focuses first on applying well-known machine learning algorithms to the dataset available from Wikipedia, Statistic Canada Census Official website & Foursquare. The first task is to define the data requirements for the Segmentation, Recommendation & Classification approach for the Toronto area. The data required for this project is collected from the following websites:\n\n1. Wikipedia List of Postal Codes of Canada\n   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M,  \n2. Geospatial Data\n   http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n3. Canada Census population data from 2016 \n   https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Tables/CompFile.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=1201&OFT=FULLCSV\n4. Foursquare Data \n\nLocation data describing places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on needs to be gathered. Once all the data ingredients are collected, I will have a better understanding of what I will be working with in the data collection stage. The data should be such that for a given location in the form of its geographical coordinates (or latitude and longitude values), one is able to determine what types of venues exist within a defined radius from that location. So for a given location I will be able to tell whether there are restaurants nearby, or other facilities, institutions such as schools, banks, parks, or gyms, or community centers and also the density of these facilities in each neighborhood. \n\nThis data is then modified as well as combined with various algorithms in the subsequent steps so that it produces the correct classifications matching those on the Customer Profile dataset. \n\n#### **2.3 Data Definition**\nThe content, format, and representations of the data needed for clustering, recommendation, and classification are defined & the explicit combination of information extraction and machine learning are executed. In this phase the data requirements are revisited and decisions are made as to whether or not the collection requires more or less data. \n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as descriptive statistics and visualization can be applied to the data set, to assess the content, quality, and initial insights about the data. Gaps in data will be identified and plans to either fill or make substitutions will have to be made \n\n#### **2.4 Neighborhood Clustering**\nClustering Algorithm produces taxonomy of location properties, namely neighborhood, with use of k-means method. The developed approach separates groups (clusters) of neighborhood with similar characteristics, which do not depend on spatial location. The segmented neighborhood data segregates the neighborhoods based on venue categories to recommend a potential buyer or renter or traveler based on their preference and with the description of a property of interest available. \n\n#### **2.5 Neighborhood Recommendation**\nRecommending products to consumers is a popular application of machine learning, especially when there exists substantial data about the customer\u2019s preferences. Even though peoples\u2019 tastes may vary, they generally follow patterns. There are similarities in the things that people tend to like ie., they tend to like things in the same category or things that share the same characteristics. \n\nOne of the main advantages of using recommendation systems to my case study is that client gets a broader exposure to many different neighborhoods he might be interested in. The idea was that people who prefer a particular destination are more likely to select a neighborhood from the same neighborhood clusters. Not only does this provide a better experience for the client but it benefits the consultant, as well, with increased potential revenue and better results for its customers.\nContent-based Recommender systems try to figure out what a client's favorite aspects of a neighborhood are, and then make recommendations on neighborhoods that share those aspects. The recommendation in a content-based system is based on client's liking for a particular neighborhood and the nature of the venue categories contained in that neighborhood. \n\nAfter clustering for each category, the cluster centers were chosen to represent the category and they become the new training sets for Classification Algorithm.\n\n#### **2.6 Final Prediction - Client Profile match**\nThe match of the client profile with the most appropriate neighborhood cluster is the final stage where the information is now distilled to provide a wide range of information in a highly focused manner. This is achieved by executing classification algorithms with KNN, Decision tree, Support Vector Machine. Finally the evaluation of each classification model is done with a view to ensure its accuracy.\n\n#### **2.7 Final Visual Representation**\nClients often feel the need to switch to different sources in search of complete information, but visual tree has been found to be more effective in customer engagement as it gives a personalized comprehensive information at a glance. The Decision Tree visualization will ease the client's understanding of the information, giving them more flexibility in discovering, using, modifying, and updating the available information according to their taste & preferences and thereby enhancing their Decision-making process. \n\n#### **2.8 Summary:**\nThe main stages consist of data collection, visualization, pre-processing, cluster with k-means algorithm, weighting term, application of Recommender system & finally classification with KNN, Decision tree, Support Vector Machine Algorithms.\nIn short, combination of Clustering, Recommender System Algorithm & Classification techniques to segregate, recommend, classify & predict the available Toronto Neighborhoods to potential clients based on their taste are employed sequentially to get the best possible outcome of their neighborhood search. \n",
